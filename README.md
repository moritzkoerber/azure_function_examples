# Azure Function Examples

This repo contains various examples of Azure Functions, for example a v1 http trigger, a v2 http trigger, a v2 blob trigger, blob copying, using a function's managed identity, delta tables etc.

The repo features functions of both programming model v1 and v2 â€“ mainly v2 though. The repo also contains an Azure Devops pipeline (yaml) to deploy the underlying infrastructure (via Terraform) and the code to the function apps.
